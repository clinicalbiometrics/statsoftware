We cannot guarantee their functioning in other hard- and software environments. You may have to do some adaptions yourself. * We have extensivly tested the programs, yet we deny liability for results from these programs.\nThis website is under development, more repositories will be added soon.\n\nStatistical modeling\nflicflac - SAS (c) macros for Firth’s correction in logistic, Cox and Poisson regression\nlogistf - R package for Firth’s correction in logistic regression (including FLIC and FLAC methods)\ncoxphf - R package for Firth’s correction in Cox regression\nshrink - R package for Global, Parameterwise and Joint Shrinkage Factor Estimation\nconcreg - R package for semiparametric concordance regression\n\n\nSurvival analysis\npshreg - SAS (c) macro for Proportional Subdistribution Hazards Regression\ncoxphw - R package for weighted Cox regression (average hazard ratio estimation)\nSurvCorr - R package for estimation of correlation coefficients with associated confidence limits for bivariate, partially censored survival times.\n\n\nExplained variation\nNecSuff - R and SAS (c) programs for degrees of necessity and of sufficiency\nrelimp - SAS (c) macro to compare the importance of prognostic factors; for logistic and Cox regression"
